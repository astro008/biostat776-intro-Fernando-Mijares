<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, but grew up mainly in Mexico City and Vancouver.</p>
<p>I am by training a physician and worked as a clinician for a couple of years before enrolling at JH. I currently have no plan of returning to clinical practice, but you never know.</p>

<div id="research-interests" class="section level2">
<h2>Research interests</h2>
<p>I previously collaborated with a lab doing a lot of Rheumatology related research.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I am interested in using imaging studies and other biomarkers to better understand the correlation between neurocognitive related diagnoses, such as dementia and mild cognitive impairment, with changes in brain anatomy.</p>
<p>I’ve honestly never been able to commit to a specific discipline for too long, which may not be the wisest thing to admit. Still, I love exploring and learning new ideas, which means I may be doing something completely unrelated to my current research in 5 years.</p>

<h2>Facts about me</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I love peanut butter</li>
<li>I watch the great British baking show way too much. It’s unhealthy. I need to stop.</li>
<li>I’ve been trying to learn Norwegian for a while, but I haven’t made much progress.</li>
<li>I once moved halfway around the world in a spur of the moment sort of way.<br />
</li>
<li>I love having breakfast for lunch or dinner, especially two sunny-side up eggs, bacon, and two slices of toast with butter and jam. It’s my ultimate comfort food for any time of the day.</li>
