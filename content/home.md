Hello! This is a personal blog created for PH140.776 Statistical Computing.

##### My name is Fernando Mijares and I am a second year masters student in the department of epidemiology.

## Background

I was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, but grew up mainly in Mexico City and Vancouver. 

I am by training a physician and worked as a clinician for a couple of years before enrolling at JH. I currently have no plan of returning to clinical practice, but you never know.

## Research interests

I previously collaborated with a lab doing a lot of Rheumatology related research. 

Nowadays, I am interested in using imaging studies and other biomarkers to better understand the correlation between neurocognitive related diagnoses, such as dementia and mild cognitive impairment, with changes in brain anatomy.

I've honestly never been able to commit to a specific discipline for too long, which may not be the wisest thing to admit. Still, I love exploring and learning new ideas, which means I may be doing something completely unrelated to my current research in 5 years.

## Facts about me

1. I love peanut butter
2. I watch the great British baking show way too much. It's unhealthy. I need to stop. 
3. I've been trying to learn Norwegian for a while, but I haven't made much progress. 
4. I once moved halfway around the world in a spur of the moment sort of way.  
5. I love having breakfast for lunch or dinner, especially two sunny-side up eggs, bacon, and two slices of toast with butter and jam. Itâ€™s my ultimate comfort food for any time of the day.
